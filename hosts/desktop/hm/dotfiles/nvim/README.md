# Neovim from scratch

This setup is inspired on Nvim from Scratch series, nvim-basic-ide and the personal nvim dotfiles from ChristianChiarulli or chris@machine on YT. 

It's a work in progress, not very stable, but normally it works under Arch Linux. 
I'll try to test most functionality on MacOS soon.
